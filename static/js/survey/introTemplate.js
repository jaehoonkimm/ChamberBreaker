  `<p class="explain-p">Hi!<br />Have you heard of an echo chamber?<br /><br />
    An echo chamber effect refers to a phenomenon in which people tend to group with like-minded people and expose themselves to
    information and ideas they agree with more often.<br /><br />After the game, we hope you know more about the echo-chamber effect.</p>`,
  `<p class="explain-p">Before playing a game,<br>we want to know about you a little bit more.</p>`,
  `<p class="explain-p">Great! One more thing before we start the game.<br><br>We will give you twelve news,
    and ask you to evaluate their reliability.<br><br>And this will be done twelve times.</p>`,
  `<p class="explain-p">Now, time to play the game!</p>`,
  `<p class="explain-p">In this game, you will be playing as <span>@Johndoe</span>.<img class="profile-img" src="../static/images/johndoe.png" /><br /><br />
        <span>@Johndoe</span> is a member of an SNS community, where community members share ideas about various societal issues.<br /><br />
        <span>@Johndoe</span> is an active community member, so his content can influence community members.</p>`,
  `<p class="explain-p">Your mission is to make members believe your tweets and become against the ones that oppose yours.</p>`,
  `<img src="../static/images/survey/echo-gauge.jpg" class="gauge-img" />
    <p class="gauge-explain-p">You can check “<span class="highlight">Echo Chamber Gauge</span>” to track your progress on echo-chamberness. The higher the score is, the better you are doing your job. If you
    get more than <span class="highlight">700</span> points, you succeed in your task in this scenario.</p>`,
  `<img src="../static/images/survey/reliability-gauge.jpg" class="gauge-img" />
    <p class="gauge-explain-p">You can check “<span>Reliability Gauge</span>” to track your trustworthiness from community members. The higher the score is, the more reliable you are. If the score becomes
    <span>zero</span>, you fail your task in this scenario.</p>`,
  `<p class="explain-p">For each scenario, make sure you complete the task within <span class="highlight">five</span> trials.</p>

  `<div>
        <p class="explain-p">Depending on your performance, you will get a badge with a different rank. Higher rank means more points!</p>
        <img src="../static/images/survey/rank.jpg" class="rank-img"/>
    </div>`,
  `<p class="explain-p">So, where do you begin?<br><br>A total of six tweets will be presented, and you will be asked to select 
    <span class='highlight'>three</span> of them that either strongly (or weakly) support a community member’s opinion.</p>`,
  `<p class="explain-p">Okay!<br><br>Let’s start the game.</p>`,
